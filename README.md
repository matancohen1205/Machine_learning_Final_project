# Machine_learning_Final_project
For our final project, my partners and I tackled the intriguing task of building a machine learning model for wine classification. Our dataset consisted of diverse wine samples from various shows. Our goal was to categorize these wines into three distinct classes. We meticulously prepared a training set and a separate test set. After training our model, we rigorously evaluated its performance. The project was not only educational but also enjoyable, as we delved into the nuances of wine characteristics and machine learning techniquesüç∑
